Course Summary


This course is an introduction into the ever-changing Digital Media world.

In this class, we will create a foundation for you in current digital media practices using Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, Audacity, Wordpress and InDesign.

You will learn how to “manipulate” digital photos to fit your needs. Shoot/edit video, “manipulate” audio, and create a blog/website. We will also discuss proper digital file naming, organizing and storing, but most importantly you will learn to value how you present yourself online and how important it is to be a professional at all times.


You are a brand.

Everything that you post online is a reflection of your Brand. Who you are, what you do, your likes/dislikes, etc.

In a way, your social media profiles are like a long digital diary that (whether you like it or not) will follow you around and will hopefully not haunt you.

I mention this because I want you to learn Digital Media Production from the point of view of how you present yourself to the digital world and how these tools could better serve you as a digital media professional. As a brand.


Course Goals:


Facility with digital tools to convey your vision
Exposure to a variety of digital media
Understanding of digital media terms
Understanding your brand
Understand copyright protection and fair use.
Become aware of how other brands use digital media
Learn how to present yourself as a professional in the digital world
Be resourceful and learn how to get the best possible content with what you have available.





Required:

iLearn Account (you already have)
YouTube or Vimeo Account (free)
Wordpress account (free)
External hard drive USB 2.0 (at least 160 GB) OR Cloud Storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc)
Headphones, ear buds


Projects

All projects need to be submitted on time. Let me repeat that, ALL PROJECTS NEED TO BE SUBMITTED ON TIME.

Late projects are penalized one whole grade and must be received within one week of due date. If a project is not received then it will be graded a zero.

If you submit your project on time but the project is incomplete or perhaps you took some “liberty” with the requirements then the project will be considered late and it will not receive a grade until it is re-submitted according to the requirements. If project is not received within a week? That’s a zero.


It is very important that YOU SAVE OFTEN and you ALWAYS SAVE TO YOUR EXTERNAL DRIVE before you leave the lab.

The computers are wiped clean often so there’s a good chance that all your great work will not be there when you come back.


Photography/Video

You can use the department’s cameras or you can use your own.

Honestly, you can even use your phone, quality is obviously important but what I really want is for you to learn the concepts behind getting the best image possible with what is available to you.


Attendance is mandatory.  Being on time is mandatory.  


You will be marked absent if you show up 30 mins late
If you are late and miss attendance you need to tell me after class
With 6 unexcused absences, you are subject to failure


We all get sick, we all have personal issues that can prevent us from attending class. That can happen to all of us, including me. But it is important that you notify us of any issue, especially those that you can foresee.

It is also very important that you reach out to your classmates if you miss a class. With the way that this class flows it will be very difficult (and unfair to the rest of the class) for us to set aside time in class to go over what you missed because you were absent.


Always feel free to contact me through the listed Marist Email.



Plagiarism

From the Marist College Student Handbook, “plagiarism may take the form of repeating another person’s sentences as your own, adopting a particularly apt phrase as your own, or paraphrasing someone else’s line of thinking in the development of a thesis as though it were your own.”  

That applies to this class in terms of you taking someone else’s photograph, or website info, or text and submitting it as your own. It also means taking someone else’s project and submitting it as your own.

Aside from being morally and ethically wrong, it is also illegal.
