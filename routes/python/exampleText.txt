Course	Description
This	course	will	focus	on	the	principles	and	techniques	of	creating	3D	models	for
visualization	and	animation.	Students	will	explore	the	processes	of	this	art	form,	including
modeling,	texturing,	shading,	scene	creation,	and	rendering,	in	order	to	create	meaningful
and	unique	visualizations.	Students	will	learn	to	output	digital	files	for	2D	prints	and	create
3D	prints	from	digital	models.
Outcomes	and	Methods
Students	will	gain	knowledge	of	3D	development,	using	the	Autodesk	Maya	software.
Students	will	become	familiar	with	current	issues	related	to	3D	graphics	through	projects
and	class	discussion.	Students	will	begin	to	develop	a	greater	understanding	and
appreciation	of	aesthetics	in	3D	representation.	Students	will	develop	a	body	of	work
reflecting	the	processes	and	materials	covered	in	class.
Each	unit	of	instruction	will	introduce	students	to	a	process	of	creating	3D	graphics.
Students	will	also	learn	some	necessary	concepts	for	creating	animations	or	simple
movement	of	3D	models.	Direct	studio	contact	between	student	and	teacher	will	reinforce
other	methods	of	instruction.	This	course	is	not	intended	to	provide	mastery	of	3D
development,	but	it	will	provide	students	with	a	full	range	of	knowledge	that	covers	the
creative	process	in	a	3D	environment.
Textbook/Supplies
Todd	Palomar,	Mastering	Autodesk	Maya	2016:	Autodesk	Official	Press,	Sybex;	1	edition
(August	10,	2015), ISBN-13: 978-1119059820
Additional	texts	and	resources	will	be	introduced	in	class.
Other	supplies	include:	Sketchbooks,	Notebooks,	external	hard	drives,	flash	drives,	etc
Please	invest	in	your	work	and	purchase	an	external	hard	drive	for	back	up	in	addition	to	a
USB	flash	drive	for	easy	transportation	and	transfer	of	digital	files.
Requirements
Regular	and	on-time	attendance	 and	participation,	including	contribution	to	critiques	and
discussions	is	mandatory.	On-time	completion	of	projects	is	required.	You	will	be	expected
to	describe	and	discuss	your	own	work	as	well	as	the	work	of	your	peers	in	forums	and
critiques.
Assessment	and	Grading
Assessment	will	be	based	on	perceived	insights	during	class	critiques	and	discussions,	as
well	as	individual	discussions	with	students	during	the	creation	of	their	projects.	Projects
will	be	evaluated	using	three	categories	or	criteria:	Project	Guidelines,	Outcomes,	and
Technical	ability.	The	guidelines	portion	of	your	grade	evaluates	the	proper	completion,
due	date,	and	presentation	of	a	project.	The	outcomes	portion	of	a	grade	will	evaluate	the
aesthetic	and	conceptual	properties	of	a	project.	The	technical	portion	of	a	grade	will
evaluate	comprehension	of	tools	and	materials	demonstrated	in	class.	Finally,	assessment
will	be	based	on	a	final	review	of	all	projects	completed	throughout	the	semester	along
with	student	participation.	Grades	will	be	submitted	and	released	on	iLearn.
