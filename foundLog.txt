Match to "description" in line "When you hear stories of infantrymen who have gone into battle zones you hear consistently that the complexities of warfare quickly fade away, and that eventually you are simply fighting for the man on your left and the man on your right. You are fighting for them and they are fighting for you and eventually the battle or the war matters less and less until you just know that you are fighting together and it is that simple; and as long as he fights on, so must you. This is the most apt description of rowing that I can muster and it rings true for me because, ultimately, this sport has never been about races won and lost, medals that hung on your neck or shirts obtained from the loser. I have always been the most moved and the most captivated by the extraordinary efforts of the men and women around me. I have loved almost every athlete to ever row or cox for me like a son or a daughter because I KNOW that they are giving every ounce of their being AND that tiny little piece of their soul to the team and to me": description

Match to "bee" in line "Coming into the spring last year the V8 was looking at a potentially fantastic spring. Based on the numbers we had seen on land and on the water, we were not only on track for an IRA bid but Stratton and I felt that we could have been in the hunt for the 3rd final which would really have been something special. The 2V and the 3V were in strong positions to support this ranking and in particular we felt that the 2V group made some substantial gains at our winter camp in DeLand. The Frosh continued to infuse the crew with excitement all winter and we were amped to be heading into Clemson with serious momentum and a number of our competitors genuinely worried. Our main target for the NIRC win was Hobart who we beat by 3sec at HOCR. It is obviously impossible to tell who would have come out on top, but my personal opinion is that we found a new gear last fall that we hadn’t seen before, and we were going to have the tools to crush Hobart in the closing meters that we didn’t have in 2019": bee

Never has it been more important to be 100% invested in one another and in the process and to give each practice your full effort and attention. Last year’s seniors are proof that you do not get that many shots at the collegiate season and it is impossible to know when it will be “your year”.

Match to "bee" in line "Coming into the spring last year the V8 was looking at a potentially fantastic spring. Based on the numbers we had seen on land and on the water, we were not only on track for an IRA bid but Stratton and I felt that we could have been in the hunt for the 3rd final which would really have been something special. The 2V and the 3V were in strong positions to support this ranking and in particular we felt that the 2V group made some substantial gains at our winter camp in DeLand. The Frosh continued to infuse the crew with excitement all winter and we were amped to be heading into Clemson with serious momentum and a number of our competitors genuinely worried. Our main target for the NIRC win was Hobart who we beat by 3sec at HOCR. It is obviously impossible to tell who would have come out on top, but my personal opinion is that we found a new gear last fall that we hadn’t seen before, and we were going to have the tools to crush Hobart in the closing meters that we didn’t have in 2019": bee
Match to "bee" in line "My final thought here is just the general sense of the teamsmanship and support that we need to provide for one another this fall. Never has it been more important to cheer eachother on, to push eachother, to grind for eachother. Never has it been more important to give a high five (elbow?) to offer some advice to a younger guy or to cut someone some slack who is trying to learn. Never has it been more important to be 100% invested in one another and in the process and to give each practice your full effort and attention. Last year’s seniors are proof that you do not get that many shots at the collegiate season and it is impossible to know when it will be “your year”. The only sure thing is that you must train and commit to the process like it’s going to be your year EVERY year. Last year’s crew had this in spades and they showed on the water that any crew can MAKE IT your year through hard work and commitment": bee
